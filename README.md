# Angular Word Cloud

My experiments with Angular libraries, [D3](https://d3js.org/) and [Word Clouds](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.5.

## Development server

Run `ng build example-ng6-lib --watch` to build and watch the library project for changes.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Running both of these commands in parallel terminals works best for development.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
